## On Agent Wrappers:

This mini-project is about how agent wrappers work. How they are built and structured, how they wrap around gall agents (and just what gall agents are, in terms of code-as-data and structures). I'll also make a simple agent wrapper and play around with it. While were at it, we might as well learn about versioned state for Gall Agents as well.
