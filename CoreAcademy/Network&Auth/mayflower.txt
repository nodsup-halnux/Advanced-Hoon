Azimuth Labs
Situation
• The Urbit star market is a “market for lemons”
• Liquidity preferences of holders are invisible
• Rational long-term speculation is difficult
• Few positive near-term marketing drivers

Technical overview
• Add a new timelocked scarcity layer with a fungible token
• $URBIT is a visa token—permission to launch a planet
• A virgin star is exchanged for 65,535 visas
• Visas unlock in tranches: 5% now, 10% 1yr, 10% 2yr, 25% 5yr, 50% 10yr

Financial overview
• Market cannot clear till supply liquidity is legible
• Classic lockups are bad—they hide/postpone illiquidity
• A tradable lockup token is like a zero-coupon bond
• A bond market separates duration from liquidity
• Everyone is 100% liquid. To trade out, you need to buy duration
• This yield curve is actually a prediction market on Urbit
• Prediction: it will reveal strong market confidence in future Urbit

Duration market
• Each tranche of visas is its own token: $URBIT, $URBIT-1, $URBIT-2, etc
• Only $URBIT needs an external market
• The Urbit contract has an API to convert between tranches
• Conversion rates are defined by a yield curve
• The yield curve is implemented by an AMM in the contract
• Initial curve is set high to reward believers

Star market
• The (virgin) star price is a derivative of the $URBIT market
• It can be calculated from the $URBIT price and yield curve
• A virgin star can be turned in for $URBIT tranches at any time
• No incentive to act except to sell or adjust duration
• The contract can auction any star or planet at any time
• For (a) active stars, (b) “vanity” star or planet names

Planet market
• Now you can buy a planet on chain
• The price is always 1 $URBIT
• The planet is issued from a star in the contract
• Hosting services have an incentive to buy issuing stars
• Stars outside the contract also burn 1 $URBIT per new planet
• Old planets are grandfathered and don’t need a visa

Structural overview
• Azimuth Labs is a new nonprofit under CEO Christopher Colby
• Assets: 4 galaxies from Urbit Foundation, 4 from Tlon, 255 stars from CY
• Mission: build and evangelize the Urbit namespace (Azimuth)
• UF changes name to Arvo Foundation and gives us urbit.org
• For us, Urbit is Azimuth
• Arvo/Tlon are just applications/features of Azimuth

Product overview
• Urban Labs exists to grow Urbit as a social network
• Urbit is wherever people use their Urbit names
• Many Web2 and Web3 use cases
• Example: Tailscale for Urbit already being built
• Labs builds both tools and apps—decentralized or centralized
• Promoting the network also promotes the token
• Labs also does the IRL events

Engineering roadmap
• Stage 0: new Azimuth contract
• Port naive rollup to Coinbase Base for efficiency/liquidity
• Stage 1: core social tools
• Web2 identity: SSO with ship/ticket on urbit.org
• Web3 identity: ENS subdomain
• Stage 2: social apps
• Public plaza on Urbit—Usenet clone?

Fundraising structure
• Urban Labs starts with 2295 contributed stars
• 45 stars go into liquidity pool for AMM
• 250 stars are turned into $URBIT and airdropped to old planets
• 2000 stars are converted to $URBIT-2 tokens
• 1000 held by Azimuth Labs treasury
• 1000 sold for USD to investors in a “soft auction”
• 1/2 to star contributors, 1/2 to Azimuth Labs


Conclusion:  Reliquidize and incentivize the stagnent market, And
increase the funding runway using tried and (not so true) methods.
Hope that urbit hardens and popularizes in time.
