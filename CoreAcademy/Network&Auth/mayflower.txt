Azimuth Labs
Situation
• The Urbit star market is a “market for lemons”
• Liquidity preferences of holders are invisible
• Rational long-term speculation is difficult
• Few positive near-term marketing drivers

Technical overview
• Add a new timelocked scarcity layer with a fungible token
• $URBIT is a visa token—permission to launch a planet
• A virgin star is exchanged for 65,535 visas
• Visas unlock in tranches: 5% now, 10% 1yr, 10% 2yr, 25% 5yr, 50% 10yr

Financial overview
• Market cannot clear till supply liquidity is legible
• Classic lockups are bad—they hide/postpone illiquidity
• A tradable lockup token is like a zero-coupon bond
• A bond market separates duration from liquidity
• Everyone is 100% liquid. To trade out, you need to buy duration
• This yield curve is actually a prediction market on Urbit
• Prediction: it will reveal strong market confidence in future Urbit

Duration market
• Each tranche of visas is its own token: $URBIT, $URBIT-1, $URBIT-2, etc
• Only $URBIT needs an external market
• The Urbit contract has an API to convert between tranches
• Conversion rates are defined by a yield curve
• The yield curve is implemented by an AMM in the contract
• Initial curve is set high to reward believers

Star market
• The (virgin) star price is a derivative of the $URBIT market
• It can be calculated from the $URBIT price and yield curve
• A virgin star can be turned in for $URBIT tranches at any time
• No incentive to act except to sell or adjust duration
• The contract can auction any star or planet at any time
• For (a) active stars, (b) “vanity” star or planet names

Planet market
• Now you can buy a planet on chain
• The price is always 1 $URBIT
• The planet is issued from a star in the contract
• Hosting services have an incentive to buy issuing stars
• Stars outside the contract also burn 1 $URBIT per new planet
• Old planets are grandfathered and don’t need a visa

Structural overview
• Azimuth Labs is a new nonprofit under CEO Christopher Colby
• Assets: 4 galaxies from Urbit Foundation, 4 from Tlon, 255 stars from CY
• Mission: build and evangelize the Urbit namespace (Azimuth)
• UF changes name to Arvo Foundation and gives us urbit.org
• For us, Urbit is Azimuth
• Arvo/Tlon are just applications/features of Azimuth

Product overview
• Urban Labs exists to grow Urbit as a social network
• Urbit is wherever people use their Urbit names
• Many Web2 and Web3 use cases
• Example: Tailscale for Urbit already being built
• Labs builds both tools and apps—decentralized or centralized
• Promoting the network also promotes the token
• Labs also does the IRL events

Engineering roadmap
• Stage 0: new Azimuth contract
• Port naive rollup to Coinbase Base for efficiency/liquidity
• Stage 1: core social tools
• Web2 identity: SSO with ship/ticket on urbit.org
• Web3 identity: ENS subdomain
• Stage 2: social apps
• Public plaza on Urbit—Usenet clone?

Fundraising structure
• Urban Labs starts with 2295 contributed stars
• 45 stars go into liquidity pool for AMM
• 250 stars are turned into $URBIT and airdropped to old planets
• 2000 stars are converted to $URBIT-2 tokens
• 1000 held by Azimuth Labs treasury
• 1000 sold for USD to investors in a “soft auction”
• 1/2 to star contributors, 1/2 to Azimuth Labs


Conclusion:  Reliquidize and incentivize the stagnent market, And
increase the funding runway using tried and (not so true) methods.
Hope that urbit hardens and popularizes in time.



Urbit:

- No reason for Normies to join.
- Star Owners:  %turf, %fund, and pseudo-yuppie clout on the network.
- No way to value unique sigils, or sell them.
- What makes a good sigil worth something, rather than a derp
sigil.
- galaxy owners care about metcalf's law.
- how do we get normies or lots of users?
    - features,
    - make money.
    - content.

How did the internet grow in the late 90s?  People realized that clicks
and searches had calculable value.  They correlated with ads,
sales, and engagement.,

- Valuing sigils: clicks and engagement, and ML on top or stats 
to try and figure out what is worth something.
- in Tlon's app, there would need to be click watching and reporting 
in a decentralized manner.  The network would need to all figure
out how much things were valued.

- What else? Shitcoin'ing on Ethereum?

why would anyone pay a lot of money for a cool urbit address / english-sounding name,
 unless the experience of being on urbit itself is worth something?
  attempting to find some other value in the address space by itself for the immediate 
  (or at least sooner than urbit becoming sufficiently valuable) 
  benefit of address space holders seems like a project that has little to do with urbit?
=> What can we actually do on urbit?
    - Chat.
    - Specialty/Interest Groups (Tlon)
    - Some Novel Apps (Turf, Radio, etc)
    - Complex, but very robust system for app development.
        => Decidedly anti Node.js in its being.
    - Minute amounts of Azimuth trades (Marketplaces)
    - Blog, and host servers. Expose blogs to normie-internet (with some work)
    - Fund other projects and build out.
    - decentralization, and more control of our data (although limited serivces, comared to web 2/3).



and seems like a vote of no confidence in urbit as a project)

frankly, designing a product that, to be valuable, needs 
lots of users because it's 
also a network, and funding it with the sale of network address 
space, that, to be valuable, needs to be scarce,  seems odd?

=> Metcalf's Law.
=> Current point market: scarcity and high demand low supply to keep prices high.
=> We want normies to pump, but we don't really want to hang out with them (Early Adopter Elitism and Commitment)
=><=




My Project:  Increase the quality of the network, via my Resonance idea.
- Mops and Sociopaths can be purged, by great minds thinking alike.
- It empowers group leaders with maximum strategy and intellect,
to periodically weed out poor community members.
    => But this is late stage, when the network is > 100k users, and quality starts to go down.

MP3 File:
- 64 galaxies set aside to develop arvo, and apps and urbit.
- This is the urbit foundation.
- The senate is the galaxy owners. The board oversees the project on behalf of the senate
- Zenith Plan:  Build a new blockchain.
- Mayflower Plan: Curtis's Plan.
- Groundwire Plan:  Comets and Bitcoin Blockchain.
- In the end, whatever the board decides, they need to convince the senate.
- The rabble will not be permitted.
- 15 UF members are left. Some more will be hired. 5 have left so far (including Josh).
- Who is responsible for hire/fire?  The Executive Director.
- A lot of UF assets actually owned by Tlon - been some transfers on network to get things more distributed (Karina)
- claim: They have extended the runway (cash to stay alive)
    => They had 2 months left. Probably over a year now.
- Sword/Ares:
- Mayflower comment: Keep it very simple, dont engage in experimental economics or financial engineering.
    - rumours pastebins are out of date, things have evolved a lot.
- Urbit Dev shifted to UF, Tlon focuses on UI products.
- in the begining: Galen and Curtis used 
- Star Congress? Need more users.  One day.
- Inherent value of gal/star v.s other mechanisms of proof of reputation
    - getting off the Naive Rollup. Allowing a lot of data to flow in the ID. 
    - individual planets can have "value" (not necessaril Exchange value), that are valuable because of their store of data
- Competing incentives: Tlon wants planets to be free, vs intentions of UF to make points value.
    - Reputation has economic value, but not transferable value!!  
- Issak: Sibil attacks are avoided by not having the cost of planets be zero.  There are attacks that can be done 
even if the average price of a planet is over $1.
    - Gary: leverage sponsorship to mitigate spam and attacks, if it occurs
    -  sponsorship is also used as a filtering mechanism in the future. A reliable sponsor star has incentives to not
    allow for bullshit or spam.
